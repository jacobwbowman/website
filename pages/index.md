About Me
</h1>

I am a PhD student in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Idaho, co-advised by Dr. Jim Nagler and Dr. Paul Hohenlohe. My research focusses on isolated populations of bull trout in Idaho's sub-alpine lakes. Outside of the office and lab, I enjoy backpacking, watching movies, and spending time with my wife and two children. I am always looking to meet other scientists, learn more about current research in conservation genomics, and talk about my work, so please reach out if any of this interests you!
