Lake-Resident Bull Trout
</h1>

Bull trout are a salmonid known to exhibit a suite of migratory strategies, but recent discovery of novel non-migratory, lake-resident bull trout populations in Idaho has interested researchers aiming to conserve this threatened species. Prior genomic analysis suggests a subset of these isolated populations may have been disconnected from migratory bull trout nearly 10,000 years ago. This begs the question: how are these small, isolated populations of fish persisting despite inbreeding and a heightened risk for stochastic extinction? My research aims to evaluate this question. I use genomic, morphometric, and ecological tools to differentiate lake-resident bull trout from their putative source populations with the goal of understanding the physical and genetic consequences of long-term isolation.

Additionally, I aim to assemble an annotated bull trout reference genome for use in my own research as well as continued bull trout management and genomic analysis.

#### Other interests

In addition to bull trout research, I am interested passionate about the field of conservation genetics as a whole. Particularly, I find genotype-environment association (GEA) and landscape genetics to be intriguing methods for understanding the adaptations of species to their surroundings, and I am interested in the use of these tools for predicting future impacts of climate change as well as possibly informing translocation efforts for conservation of imperilled species.
