### Isolated lake-resident bull trout

Bull trout are a salmonid known to exhibit a suite of migratory strategies, but recent discovery of novel non-migratory, lake-resident bull trout populations in Idaho has interested researchers aiming to conserve this threatened species. Prior genomic analysis suggests a subset of these isolated populations may have been disconnected from migratory bull trout nearly 10,000 years ago. This begs the question: how are these small, isolated populations of fish persisting despite inbreeding and a heightened risk for stochastic extinction? My research aims to evaluate this question. I use genomic, morphometric, and ecological tools to differentiate lake-resident bull trout from their putative source populations with the goal of understanding the physical and genetic consequences of long-term isolation.
